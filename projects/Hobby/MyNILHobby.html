<h2>My Social Law hobby</h2>
        
    
          <p>I am Felix, my hobby is United Nations reform, 
              Ethnic and Racial Studies,Assimilation and Pluralism
              From Immigrants to White Ethnics, Rule of Law, New eugenics,
              transhumanism,
              restrictions of governmental violence, sociological futurism.</p>
        
          <br>
          
          <p>I going deeper and deeper on a study, explaining, 
              why are the people have some exact expectations, 
              why people not happy with presidents and two-party system of United States.
              I suggest, that this 200 employers of coordinating center, 
              will be elected by people of the United States. And other countries can
             do the same with their representatives to new international dialog platform.
              At the entire world, we got a huge amount of human rights and political groups. 
             Elimination of UN can open fresh vacancies for all kinds of small political non-profits 
             to being heard and rise their voices.
             Now, the way UN representatives spent money is well known- luxury hotels, 
             business class flights, delicious dishes and so on.</p>
        
          <br>
        
          <p>People of the world need coordinating center
            For all non profit and political organizations.
            It can be limited by at least 200 employers,
            and limited budget which no exceed 300 000 000$/year.
            (20 times less than taxpayers spent to UN now!) 
            This amount will be pretty fit for all the translations,
            Necessary transportation needs, hotels and all
            software and hardware, also as salaries itself.</p>
