      <p>My name is Feliks, I completed a course at Geodesy and Cartography college and I study Web Design at MEDA, San Francisco. I study international law because I saw a lot of cases 
        when government doesn’t act lawfully with people and we need completely new system. That’s why I founded non-profit New International Law that helps people in few ways. 
        .	My hobby is doing a perfect jokes. I think laughs is a best cure for all disease. My health is very bad, so its a very essential for me to trolling people around, sometimes it’s bad, because somebody can feel hurt with my jokes.</p>

      <h2>About me part 2</h2>
      <p>Talking about anything, I prefer to make a different opinion from everyone. I like when people attacked me and hate me online. 
        .	Before I did so many investigations about corruption, filed a lawsuits in court, connected journalists. 
        later it start to seems useless for me.</p>
